# Firebase Indexes Setup Guide

Based on the debug logs, your app requires several Firebase indexes that are currently missing. This is causing issues with data retrieval and engagement calculation.

## Missing Indexes

You need to create the following composite indexes:

### 1. community_notices Collection

```
Collection: community_notices
Fields to index:
  - communityId (Ascending)
  - createdAt (Ascending)
  - __name__ (Ascending)
```

Create at: https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/pulse-app-ea5be/firestore/indexes?create_composite=Cllwcm9qZWN0cy9wdWxzZS1hcHAtZWE1YmUvZGF0YWJhc2VzLyhkZWZhdWx0KS9jb2xsZWN0aW9uR3JvdXBzL2NvbW11bml0eV9ub3RpY2VzL2luZGV4ZXMvXxABGg8KC2NvbW11bml0eUlkEAEaDQoJY3JlYXRlZEF0EAEaDAoIX19uYW1lX18QAQ

### 2. RTDB Rules Update

Update your RTDB rules to properly track likes and comments:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "community_notices": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".indexOn": ["communityId", "createdAt"],
      "$noticeId": {
        ".write": "auth != null",
        ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['title', 'content', 'authorId', 'authorName', 'communityId'])",
        "likes": {
          ".write": "auth != null",
          "$userId": {
            ".validate": "auth.uid === $userId",
            ".write": "auth.uid === $userId"
          }
        },
        "comments": {
          ".write": "auth != null",
          "$commentId": {
            ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['content', 'authorId', 'authorName', 'timestamp'])",
            "authorId": {
              ".validate": "auth.uid === newData.val()"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Steps to Apply Changes

1. Update your RTDB rules with the new rules above
2. Restart your app to apply the changes
3. Test the engagement calculation by:
   - Creating a new notice
   - Liking the notice as an admin
   - Commenting on the notice as an admin
   - Checking the engagement report

The engagement calculation should now properly track:
- Admin likes on notices
- Admin comments on notices
- User interactions (likes and comments)
- Report submissions
- Volunteer participation
- Marketplace activity

## Additional Notes

1. The engagement rate is calculated based on:
   - Total activities (likes, comments, reports, etc.)
   - Possible activities (based on community size)
   - Active users ratio
   - Admin interactions

2. The current engagement rate of 68% is based on:
   - Volunteer participation: 4
   - Marketplace activity: 9
   - Report submissions: 14
   - Total activities: 30
   - Possible activities: 44

3. After applying these changes, the engagement rate should increase as admin interactions are properly tracked.

### 3. volunteer_posts Collection

```
Collection: volunteer_posts
Fields to index:
  - communityId (Ascending)
  - date (Ascending)
  - __name__ (Ascending)
```

### 5. reports Collection

```
Collection: reports
Fields to index:
  - communityId (Ascending)
  - createdAt (Ascending)
  - __name__ (Ascending)

### 6. community_notices Collection with authorId

```
Collection: community_notices
Fields to index:
  - authorId (Ascending)
  - communityId (Ascending)
  - createdAt (Ascending)

## Steps to Create Indexes

1. Click each of the links above to open the Firebase Console
2. Sign in to your Firebase account if needed
3. Review the index definition and click "Create Index"
4. Wait for the indexes to be created (this may take a few minutes)
5. Restart your app after all indexes are created

Once all the indexes are created, your engagement calculation should work properly, as the app will be able to retrieve the necessary data from Firestore.

## Additional Database Permissions Issue

The error log also shows permission issues with Firebase Realtime Database:

```
W/SyncTree(21465): Listen at /chats failed: DatabaseError: This client does not have permission to perform this operation
W/SyncTree(21465): Listen at /community_notices failed: DatabaseError: This client does not have permission to perform this operation
```

You should update your Firebase Realtime Database rules to allow your authenticated users to access these paths.
